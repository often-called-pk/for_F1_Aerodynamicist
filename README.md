the F1_aerodynamicist project
i was able to clone the repo into mine and got familiar with the FastF1 api.
then i started working on making it more user friendly
the original script was just fixed to fetch data for 3 drivers - Norris, Hamilton and Verstappen and for just turn 1 and 2 [basically as the script says, between the distance markers 1140 and 2400]
i was able to modiy the script to create a webapp which will have dropdowns to select year, GP, and you can select any 3 drivers from the grid to compare. I want to extend this graph to cover the complete distance of the lap.
If you could help me with a resource to determine the distance markers for turns in all the tracks, then we could also incorporate a drop down for the turns that we want to plot the data for. Please suggest me any more functionalities i should build in. 
i was able to create this for the cornering_3_DRVS.py
if it looks good then i will start working on the other scripts as well.
